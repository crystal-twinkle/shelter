Hello! 
Welcome to my first project [RS School](https://rs.school).
This project aimed to create a user-friendly web application designed to assist animal shelters and rescue organizations in managing their operations efficiently.

Added Functionality:

***Burger Menu (Mobile Navigation)***: A responsive burger menu that automatically appears when the screen width falls below 768px. This menu provides a smooth and user-friendly navigation experience on smaller screens, ensuring that users can easily access all areas of the website.

***Infinite Slider Carousel (Main Page)***: The Main page of Shelter now boasts an infinite slider carousel that showcases featured animals and shelter initiatives. This dynamic addition keeps website visitors engaged by continuously cycling through compelling content, providing an immersive experience.

***Pagination (Pets Page)***: To improve the browsing experience on the Pets page, we've introduced a pagination feature. Users can now explore a larger number of pet listings with ease. The pagination system allows for the efficient organization and presentation of pets available for adoption.

***Popup (On Both Pages)***: To enhance user interaction and provide additional information, we've integrated a popup feature on both pages. When users click on any part of a specific animal's description card, a popup window appears, providing additional information about the selected animal. This feature enriches the user experience by providing on-demand content without leaving the current page.
